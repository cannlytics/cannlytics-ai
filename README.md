Cannlytics AI leverages the comparative advantage of Cannlytics in aggregating cannabis data from disparate resources to provide you with clean, standardized data. Cannlytics AI provides you with a rich buffet of cannabis data, automatically, without mistakes, flaws, or complaint.

## üå± Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You can simply clone the repository to get your hands on the AI source code.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics-ai.git
```

You will also need to create and save the following credentials in your `env.yaml`.

- `FRED_API_KEY`: You can sign up for a free API key at <http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/>.
- `SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN`: You will need a [Socrata Application Token](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html) to collect data from certain states, such as Massachusetts and Connecticut.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Quickstart <a name="quickstart"></a>

You can run each data collection routine through the command line. For example:

```shell
python ai/get_cannabis_data/get_data_ma.py
```

## üî® Development <a name="development"></a>

Please see the [data collection guides](guides/data/data-collection.md) for information on how public data is collected.

## ü¶æ Automation <a name="automation"></a>

Now for the fun part, automation.

> Note that you will need to [enable billing for your project](http://console.cloud.google.com/billing), [enable the Cloud Scheduler API](http://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudscheduler.googleapis.com), and [enable the Pub/Sub API](http://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/pubsub.googleapis.com).

1. Create a Pub/Sub topic:

    ```
    gcloud pubsub topics create get_cannabis_data_daily
    ```

2. Deploy the function:

    ```
    gcloud functions deploy get_cannabis_data_daily --entry-point get_cannabis_data_daily --runtime python39 --trigger-topic get_cannabis_data_daily --memory 1024MB --timeout 300 --env-vars-file env.yaml
    ```

3. Finally, create a [Cloud Scheduler](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating#gcloud) cron job:

    ```
    gcloud scheduler jobs create pubsub get_cannabis_data_daily --schedule "20 4 * * *" --topic get_cannabis_data_daily --message-body "success"
    ```

Your function should now run nicely everyday at 4:20am. You can read the logs for your function with:

```
gcloud functions logs read get_cannabis_data_daily
```

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Testing <a name="testing"></a>

You can run tests with code coverage with `pytest`.

```
pytest --cov=ai tests/
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Support <a name="support"></a>
